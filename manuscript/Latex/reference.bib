	abstract = {The first national product of Surface Water Dynamics in France (SWDF) is generated on a monthly temporal scale and 10-m spatial scale using an automatic rule-based superpixel (RBSP) approach. The current surface water dynamic products from high resolution (HR) multispectral satellite imagery are typically analyzed to determine the annual trend and related seasonal variability. Annual and seasonal time series analyses may fail to detect the intra-annual variations of water bodies. Sentinel-2 allows us to investigate water resources based on both spatial and temporal high-resolution analyses. We propose a new automatic RBSP approach on the Google Earth Engine platform. The RBSP method employs combined spectral indices and superpixel techniques to delineate the surface water extent; this approach avoids the need for training data and benefits large-scale, dynamic and automatic monitoring. We used the proposed RBSP method to process Sentinel-2 monthly composite images covering a two-year period and generate the monthly surface water extent at the national scale, i.e., over France. Annual occurrence maps were further obtained based on the pixel frequency in monthly water maps. The monthly dynamics provided in SWDF products are evaluated by HR satellite-derived water masks at the national scale (JRC GSW monthly water history) and at local scales (over two lakes, i.e., Lake Der-Chantecoq and Lake Orient, and 200 random sampling points). The monthly trends between SWDF and GSW were similar, with a coefficient of 0.94. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on the sample points were 0.885 (producer's accuracy), 0.963 (user's accuracy), 0.932 (overall accuracy) and 0.865 (Matthews correlation coefficient). The annual surface water extents (i.e., permanent and maximum) are validated by two HR satellite image-based water maps and an official database at the national scale and small water bodies (ponds) at the local scale at Loir-et-Cher. The results show that the SWDF results are closely correlated to the previous annual water extents, with a coefficient {\textgreater}0.950. The SWDF results are further validated for large rivers and lakes, with extraction rates of 0.929 and 0.802, respectively. Also, SWDF exhibits superiority to GSW in small water body extraction (taking 2498 ponds in Loir-et-Cher as example), with an extraction rate improved by approximately 20\%. Thus, the SWDF method can be used to study interannual, seasonal and monthly variations in surface water systems. The monthly dynamic maps of SWDF improved the degree of land surface coverage by 25\% of France on average compared with GSW, which is the only product that provides monthly dynamics. Further harmonization of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and the introduction of enhanced cloud detection algorithm can fill some gaps of no-data regions.},

High-resolution maps of inland surface water bodies are important for water supply and natural disaster mitigation as well as for monitoring, managing, and preserving landscapes and ecosystems. In this paper, we propose an automatic surface water mapping workflow by training a deep residual neural network (ResNet) based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data, where the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) superpixel algorithm was employed for generating object-based training samples. As a case study, we produced an open surface water layer for Germany using a national ResNet model at a 10 m spatial resolution, which was then harmonized with OSM data for final surface water products. Moreover, we evaluated the mapping accuracy of our open water products via conducting expert validation campaigns, and comparing to existing water products, namely the WasserBLIcK and Global Surface Water Layer (GSWL). Using 4,600 validation samples in Germany, the proposed model (ResNet+SNIC) achieved an overall accuracy of 86.32\% and competitive detection rates over the WasserBLIcK (87.47\%) and GSWL (98.61\%). This study provides comprehensive insights into how to best explore the synergy of VGI and ML of EO data in a large-scale surface water mapping task.},

              Urban lakes provide important ecological services to local communities, such as flood mitigation, biodiversity, and recreation. With rapid urbanization, urban lakes are significantly affected by socio-economic development and urgently need attention. Yet there is still a lack of datasets that include tiny urban lakes on a global or national scale. This study aims to produce a high-resolution circa-2020 map of urban lakes (≥0.001 km

              ) in China. The 10-m-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and a simple but robust water extraction method was used to generate waterbodies. The accuracy of this national-scale dataset was evaluated by comparing it with manually sampled urban units, with the average accuracy of 81.85\% in area and 93.35\% in count. The database totally inventories 1.11 × 10

Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efﬁcient inference and learning. We deﬁne and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classiﬁcation networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by ﬁne-tuning to the segmentation task. We then deﬁne a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, ﬁne layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30\% relative improvement to 67.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	abstract = {Dams and reservoirs are among the most widespread human-made infrastructures on Earth. Despite their societal and environmental significance, spatial inventories of dams and reservoirs, even for the large ones, are insufficient. A dilemma of the existing georeferenced dam datasets is the polarized focus on either dam quantity and spatial coverage (e.g., GlObal geOreferenced Database of Dams, GOODD) or detailed attributes for a limited dam quantity or region (e.g., GRanD (Global Reservoir and Dam database) and national inventories). One of the most comprehensive datasets, the World Register of Dams (WRD), maintained by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), documents nearly 60 000 dams with an extensive suite of attributes. Unfortunately, the WRD records provide no geographic coordinates, limiting the benefits of their attributes for spatially explicit applications. To bridge the gap between attribute accessibility and spatial explicitness, we introduce the Georeferenced global Dams And Reservoirs (GeoDAR) dataset, created by utilizing the Google Maps geocoding application programming interface (API) and multi-source inventories. We release GeoDAR in two successive versions (v1.0 and v1.1) at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6163413 (Wang et al., 2022). GeoDAR v1.0 holds 22 560 dam points georeferenced from the WRD, whereas v1.1 consists of (a) 24 783 dam points after a harmonization between GeoDAR v1.0 and GRanD v1.3 and (b) 21 515 reservoir polygons retrieved from high-resolution water masks based on a one-to-one relationship between dams and reservoirs. Due to geocoding challenges, GeoDAR spatially resolved ∼ 40 \% of the records in the WRD, which, however, comprise over 90 \% of the total reservoir area, catchment area, and reservoir storage capacity. GeoDAR does not release the proprietary WRD attributes, but upon individual user requests we may provide assistance in associating GeoDAR spatial features with the WRD attribute information that users have acquired from ICOLD. Despite this limit, GeoDAR, with a dam quantity triple that of GRanD, significantly enhances the spatial details of smaller but more widespread dams and reservoirs and complements other existing global dam inventories. Along with its extended attribute accessibility, GeoDAR is expected to benefit a broad range of applications in hydrologic modeling, water resource management, ecosystem health, and energy planning.},

Level 1 comprises the shoreline polygons of the 3067 largest lakes (surface area ≥50 km2) and 654 largest reservoirs (storage capacity ≥0.5 km3) worldwide, and offers extensive attribute data. Level 2 contains the shoreline polygons of approx. 250,000 smaller lakes, reservoirs and rivers (surface area ≥0.1 km2), excluding all water bodies of level 1. Finally, level 3 represents lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and different wetland types in the form of a global raster map at 30-second resolution, including all water bodies of levels 1 and 2. In a validation against documented data, GLWD proved to represent a comprehensive database of global lakes ≥1 km2 and to provide a good representation of the maximum global wetland extent. GLWD-1 and GLWD-2 establish two global polygon maps to which existing lake registers, compilations or remote sensing data can be linked in order to allow for further analyses in a GIS environment. GLWD-3 may serve as an estimate of wetland extents for global hydrology and climatology models, or to identify large-scale wetland distributions and important wetland complexes.},

We use new data sources, enhanced spatial resolution, and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface-water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; 4.2 million km2 in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km2. Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large, engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately 0.26 million km2. However, construction of low-tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1\% and 6\% of farm area worldwide, dependent upon precipitation, and represents ≫77,000 km2 globally, at present. Overall, about 4.6 million km2 of the earth's continental “land” surface (≫3\%) is covered by water. These analyses underscore the importance of explicitly considering lakes, ponds, and impoundments, especially small ones, in global analyses of rates and processes.},

	abstract = {Spatial distribution information offers a valuable resource for the growing research on evaluating and managing aquaculture and the mechanism of its interaction with the environment, especially concerning landside clustering aquaculture ponds (LCAP). However, studies aimed at obtaining data on global LCAP distribution remains limited. This study combined edge detection and the morphology implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to produce the first global spatial distribution data of LCAP using 4,015,054 tiles of the 10-m Sentinel-2 time-series images collected throughout 2020. The study findings showed a total area of global LCAP of 55,337.03 km2. Asia, led by China, had the highest distribution area of LCAP, accounting for 89.12 \% of global LCAP. The main LCAP distribution area was the landside 30-km buffer region of coastline, accounting for 75.57 \% of global LCAP. Meanwhile, the greatest proportion of LCAP (69.63 \%) was located in China. Accuracy verification revealed that the precision and recall error of the results were 83.91 \% and 92.49 \% respectively, and F1 score was 0.88. A comparison of China, Vietnam, and India, based on data drawn from most of the existing local studies that used remote sensing methods, showed that these countries’ aquaculture area differs by less than 10 \%. Despite some variation from FAO statistics or official national statistics, the results of our remote sensing-based method show promise in such aspects as global coverage and temporal coherency when compared with the classical statistical method.},

A detailed global characterization of lakes and their long-term dynamics does not exist, which is however crucial for evaluating the associated impacts on water availability and carbon emissions. Here, we map 3.4 million lakes on a global scale, including their explicit maximum extents and probability-weighted area changes over the past four decades. From the beginning period (1984–1999) to the end (2010–2019), the lake area increased across all six continents analyzed, with a net change of +46,278 km2, and 56\% of the expansion was attributed to reservoirs. Interestingly, although small lakes ({\textless}1 km2) accounted for just 15\% of the global lake area, they dominated the variability in total lake size in half of the global inland lake regions. The identified lake area increase over time led to higher lacustrine carbon emissions, mostly attributed to small lakes. Our findings illustrate the emerging roles of small lakes in regulating not only local inland water variability, but also the global trends of surface water extent and carbon emissions.},

            The surfaces of rivers and streams are interfaces for a host of chemical exchanges with the atmosphere and biosphere. For instance, carbon dioxide outgassing from rivers is estimated to be equivalent to one-fifth of combined emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. Allen and Pavelsky used satellite imagery to estimate the surface area of rivers and streams (see the Perspective by Palmer and Ruhi). The stunning map that they generated results in an upward revision, by about one-third, to the total surface area of rivers and streams on Earth.

            The turbulent surfaces of rivers and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere. At the global scale, the total river-atmosphere flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth’s surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of rivers and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform river hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global river and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 ± 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 ± 0.06\%) of Earth’s nonglaciated land surface, an area 44 ± 15\% larger than previous spatial estimates. We found that rivers and streams likely play a greater role in controlling land-atmosphere fluxes than is currently represented in global carbon budgets.},

	abstract = {Inland lakes, important water resources, play a crucial role in the global water cycle and are sensitive to climate change and human activities. There clearly is a pressing need to understand temporal and spatial variations of lakes at global and continental scales. The recent operation of Landsat 8 extends the unprecedented Landsat record to over 40 years, allowing long-term, large-scale lake dynamics mapping at high resolutions. Using our circa2000 lake product derived from Landsat 7 images as a reference, this research produces a circa-2015 map of representative lake extents and distributions, and addresses seasonal and inter-annual lake area variability using Landsat 8 images acquired in lake stable seasons at a continental scale. Oceania is chosen here as a case study as it contains a large group of salt lakes that exhibit high area variability and has the most intensive image coverage during the ﬁrst 2.5-year operation of Landsat 8. Accordingly, this paper describes an adaptive algorithm to automate lake mapping for various surface conditions using images acquired during lake stable seasons and a compositing scheme in the vector domain to generate a representative continental mosaic of lake extents from multi-temporal mapping. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods produce a highly reliable and representative composite of highly-variable lake extents across Oceania, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale lake mapping projects using multi-temporal data.},

	abstract = {Floodplains are a vital part of the global riverine system. Among all the global floodplain delineation strategies empowered by remote sensing, digital elevation model (DEM)-based delineation is considered to be computationally efficient with relatively low uncertainties, but the parsimonious model struggles with incorporating the basin-level spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological and geomorphic influences into the map. In this study, we propose a globally applicable thresholding scheme for DEM-based floodplain delineation to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, we develop a stepwise approach to estimate the floodplain hydraulic geometry (FHG) scaling parameters for river basins worldwide at the scale of the level-3 HydroBASINS to best respect the scaling law while approximating the spatial extent of two publicly available global flood maps derived from hydrodynamic modeling. The estimated FHG exponent exhibits a significant positive relationship with the basins' hydroclimatic conditions, particularly in 33 of the world's major river basins, indicating the ability of the approach to capture fingerprints from heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphic influences. Based on the spatially varying FHG parameters, a ∼ 90 m resolution global floodplain map named the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT) is delineated, which takes the hydrologically corrected MERIT Hydro dataset as the DEM inputs and the height above nearest drainage (HAND) as the terrain attribute. Our results demonstrate that SHIFT validates better with reference maps than both hydrodynamic-modeling- and DEM-based approaches with universal parameters. The improved delineation mainly includes better differentiation between main streams and tributaries in major basins and a more comprehensive representation of stream networks in aggregated river basins. SHIFT estimates the global floodplain area to be 9.91×106 km2, representing 6.6 \% of the world's total land area. SHIFT data layers are available at two spatial resolutions (90 m and 1 km), along with the updated parameters, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11835133 (Zheng et al., 2024). We anticipate that SHIFT will be used to support applications requiring boundary delineations of the global geomorphic floodplains.},

One of the major issues that scientists and policy makers now confront is how to assess such massive changes over multiple scales of space and time. Lakes and reservoirs comprise a geographically distributed network of the lowest points in the surrounding landscape that make them important sentinels of climate change. Their physical, chemical, and biological responses to climate provide a variety of information-rich signals. Their sediments archive and integrate these signals, enabling paleolimnologists to document changes over years to millennia. Lakes are also hot spots of carbon cycling in the landscape and as such are important regulators of climate change, processing terrestrial and atmospheric as well as aquatic carbon. We provide an overview of this concept of lakes and reservoirs as sentinels, integrators, and regulators of climate change, as well as of the need for scaling and modeling these responses in the context of global climate change. We conclude by providing a brief look to the future and the creation of globally networked sensors in lakes and reservoirs around the world.},

This methodology provides a near-global database and analysis of glacial lake extent, volume and change. Over the study period, lake numbers and total area increased by 53 and 51\%, respectively. Median lake size has increased 3\%; however, the 95th percentile has increased by around 9\%. Currently, glacial lakes hold about 0.43 mm of sea level equivalent.

	abstract = {Central to the looming paradigm shift toward data-intensive science, machine-learning techniques are becoming increasingly important. In particular, deep learning has proven to be both a major breakthrough and an extremely powerful tool in many fields. Shall we embrace deep learning as the key to everything? Or should we resist a black-box solution? These are controversial issues within the remote-sensing community. In this article, we analyze the challenges of using deep learning for remote-sensing data analysis, review recent advances, and provide resources we hope will make deep learning in remote sensing seem ridiculously simple. More importantly, we encourage remote-sensing scientists to bring their expertise into deep learning and use it as an implicit general model to tackle unprecedented, large-scale, influential challenges, such as climate change and urbanization.},

	abstract = {As water is considered one of the essential assets of nature, the recognition of the availability of water at a specific location can help government bodies to take necessary action toward water conservation. Monitoring water from satellite images is considered one of the most difficult areas of pattern recognition. In this manner, a novel multi-level feature fusion approach is proposed to predict the pattern of water concerning a specific location to analyze the scale and availability. The proposed framework can access the spatial features from sentinel-2 images by utilizing the concept of structural learning. For evaluating the prediction performance, the calculated outcomes are compared with the traditional and modern pattern recognition approaches. It has been observed that the proposed approach is more robust in terms of pattern analysis as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on different training and testing ratios such as 70:30, 75:25, and 80:20. In this manner, the calculated outcomes define the pattern recognition efficiency of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art approaches by achieving 94.51\% of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Lakes are among the most prevalent and predominant water repositories on the Earth's land surface. A primary objective of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission is to monitor surface water elevation, area, and storage change in lakes globally. To meet this objective, prior information on lakes, such as locations and benchmark extents, is required to organize SWOT's KaRIn observations for computing lake storage variation over time. Here, we present the SWOT mission Prior Lake Database (PLD) to fulfill this requirement. This paper emphasizes the development of the “operational PLD,” which consists of (a) a high‐resolution mask encompassing approximately 6 million lakes and reservoirs that meet the minimum size criterion of 1 ha, as defined in SWOT’s lake observation science goals, and (b) multiple operational auxiliaries that support the lake mask in generating SWOT's standard lake vector data products. We built the prior lake mask by harmonizing the UCLA Circa‐2015 Global Lake Dataset and several state‐of‐the‐art reservoir databases. Operational auxiliaries were produced from multi‐theme geospatial data to provide essential information for PLD functionality, including lake catchments and influence areas, ice phenology, relationship with SWOT prior rivers, and spatiotemporal coverage by SWOT overpasses. Globally, over three quarters of the prior lakes are smaller than 10 ha. About 97\% of the lakes, constituting half of the global lake area, are fully observed at least once per orbit cycle. The PLD will be recursively improved throughout the mission lifetime and serves as a critical framework for organizing, processing, and interpreting SWOT observations over lacustrine environments with fundamental significance to lake system science.},

This is the first meta-analysis to incorporate simultaneously external geospatial data and ecosystem service interactions. We first show that it is possible to reliably predict the value of ecosystem services provided by lakes based on their physical and geographic characteristics. Second, we demonstrate that interactions between ecosystem services appear to be significant for explaining lake ecosystem service values. Third, we provide an estimation of the average value of ecosystem services provided by lakes: between 106 and 140 USD\$2010 per respondent per year for non-hedonic price studies and between 169 and 403 USD\$2010 per property per year for hedonic price studies.},

Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Deep-learning segmentation frameworks rely not only on the choice of network architecture but also on the choice of loss function. When the segmentation process targets rare observations, a severe class imbalance is likely to occur between candidate labels, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In order to mitigate this issue, strategies such as the weighted cross-entropy function, the sensitivity function or the Dice loss function, have been proposed. In this work, we investigate the behavior of these loss functions and their sensitivity to learning rate tuning in the presence of different rates of label imbalance across 2D and 3D segmentation tasks. We also propose to use the class re-balancing properties of the Generalized Dice overlap, a known metric for segmentation assessment, as a robust and accurate deep-learning loss function for unbalanced tasks.},

Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

The increase in data with a very high spatial resolution enables investigations on a fine-grained feature level which can help us to better understand the dynamics of land surfaces by taking object dynamics into account. To extract fine-grained features and objects, the most popular deep-learning model for image analysis is commonly used: the convolutional neural network (CNN). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of deep learning on EO applications by reviewing 429 studies on image segmentation and object detection with CNNs. We extensively examine the spatial distribution of study sites, employed sensors, used datasets and CNN architectures, and give a thorough overview of applications in EO which used CNNs. Our main finding is that CNNs are in an advanced transition phase from computer vision to EO. Upon this, we argue that in the near future, investigations which analyze object dynamics with CNNs will have a significant impact on EO research. With a focus on EO applications in this Part II, we complete the methodological review provided in Part I.},
